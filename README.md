#### What is MacWrite?

It's a simple text editing app that runs in the browser and uses <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a> and its API to manage identity and storage.

It's named after the famous and much-loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">demo app</a> that came with the original Mac in 1984. It was what I call a software <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint">coral reef</a>.

I've provided the full source code to the app in this repo. You can try it out on <a href="http://macwrite.org/">macwrite.org</a>, a domain that was available, so I am using it, with great reverence of course. ;-)
