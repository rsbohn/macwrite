# macwrite

A simple demo app for <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a>.

#### What is MacWrite?

It's a simple text editing app that runs in the browser and uses nodeStorage and its API to manage identity and storage.

It's named after the famous and much-loved demo app that came with the original Mac in 1984.

I've provided the full source code to the app in this repo. You can try it out on <a href="http://macwrite.org/">macwrite.org</a>, a domain that was available, so I am using it, with great reverence of course. ;-)
